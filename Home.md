# Data Journalism Newsletters

For now there are six newsletter in this series though more may be added aver time. [[todo: add newsletter subscription link](Issues.md)]

**Purpose**: A series of six newsletters sent asynchronously to subscribers when they sign up. The newsletters introduce the idea of data journalism, some of the ways to get started with data journalism, and some of the tools of the trade. The guide is intended as a starting point for data journalism.

**What this is not**: This is not a comprehensive guide to data journalism. Nor is it a hands-on tutorial to doing data journalism.

**Tone**: The guide series is light, easily read and personal.

#### Newsletter 1

## Introduction :email:

Welcome to the first in a series of newsletters about getting started with data journalism from [The Outlier](https://theoutlier.co.za). You probably already know this but just to make sure:

- There are six newsletters in this series.
- One newsletter will be sent out every week for six weeks.
- Each newsletter will cover a specific area of data journalism:
  1 - What/why is data journalism (this email)
  2 - The basic tools of data journalism
  3 - How to find data for projects
  4 - Why and how you should "clean" data
  5 - The basics of analysing data and finding an angle
  6 - Getting started with data visualisation

That's a lot of ground to cover over just six weeks so we won't be able to go into great detail on each of these areas but our intention is that it will be enough to help you get started with data journalism and to become familiar with the core concepts. Later on in the series we'll look at some resources that you can look at to start expanding your skills.

**:exclamation:But first, an important note**: This is an evolving course. Over time we will be updating it with new information and techniques if we think they will improve the overall course. If you have any questions or suggestions, or things that you think we didn't explain well enough, please let us know so we can improve explanations or add in things we left out. You can email us at [ddjnewsletter@theoutlier.co.za](mailto:ddjnewsletter@theoutlier.co.za). Any and all feedback is hugely welcomed. Alternatively, join our [Outlier Discord channel](https://discord.gg/Qf9AkFeXEF) and talk with us there.

Also, see the foot of this email for more information and contacts.

## What is data journalism? :bar_chart: :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Data journalism is a lot of different things to a lot of different people but boradly speaking it is the practice of doing journalism using, mostly, data. Perhaps the easiest way to describe data journalism is that it is journalism in which data is very often the subject of reasearch or the "interviewee". This differs from traditional jounalism which tends to report of events and interviews people.

This is not to say data journalism isn't about people, it most often is, but it generally approaches the issues of the day from the perspective of data. For example, a story on elections might compare the elections of the past few years while traditional journalism might report on the speeches made by candidates. Traditional journalism might write a story about school systems by interviewing pupils, teachers and administrators while a data journalist may analyse school infrastructure reports looking for patterns.

Data journalism is not really all that different from "normal" journalism. In traditional journalism a journalist will build relationships with "sources" so they are informed of when things happen or change. A data journalist may do the same by tracking data around a particular issue over time to see how things change.

Data journalism is a relatively new field of work and there are some misconcpetions about what it is and what it isn't. Here are a few of those:

- Data journalism is [word for unfeeling/mechanical]. This is not necessarily true. Data very often represents people and, in many cases, their struggles. Understanding data about unemployment, gender-based violence, homelessness from example often allows us to tell a more compelling story that simply quoting relevant officials.

- Data journalism is hard. Data journalism can be very hard. But then so is finding that perfect interview or video shot to tell most other stories. Don't be fooled, like most things, doing any form of journalism is hard if done properly, and data journalism is no exception.

- Data journalism is full of maths. This is only partially true. It's true that while a good grasp of maths and statistics can often help it is far from required. There are some basic maths that you ought to know but almost all of it you probably already know or you can learn quickly.

- Data journalism is all about graphics and visualisations. This is perhaps the biggest mistake that most people make, though understandably so. Most of the high-profile examples we see of data journalism include some form of visualisation. But this doesn't always have to be the case. Good data journalism can simply be the foundations for a well-written story or investigation. If the data is good enough it's possible to add in a visualisation to helop tell the story but it's absolutely not essential.
