# Data Journalism Newsletters

For now there are six newsletter in this series though more may be added aver time. [todo:newsletter-link](Issues.md)

**Purpose**: A series of six newsletters sent asynchronously to subscribers when they sign up. The newsletters introduce the idea of data journalism, some of the ways to get started with data journalism, and some of the tools of the trade. The guide is intended as a starting point for data journalism.
